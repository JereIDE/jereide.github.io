# Setup

When you open JereIDE, a welcome page would show with the version, the logo, and the tagline.

## Get to Know the Command Palette

JereIDE has a useful Command Palette so you can search and run the commands you need. Press `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P` to open it. Press `Esc`, click outside, or execute a command to close it. You can select commands with top/down arrows or your mouse. You can run them with `Enter` or `Return`.

## Creating, Writing, and Saving Tabs in JereIDE

Press `Cmd/Ctrl+N` to open a new tab.

The new tab will appear with a blank editor, with "Untitled" in the tab title. You can start typing now. After you are done, press `Cmd/Ctrl+S` to save the file. A dialog will open and you can choose a filename(and the extension too) and save it in the directory you want.

If a file is modified, or "dirty", a dot will appear to the left of the tab title. After you save it, the dirty dot will vanish.

You can always close a tab by pressing `Cmd/Ctrl+W`.

> [!TIP]
> All of these commands are available in the command palette as `file: new`, `file: save`, `file: close tab`, etc.

## Opening Files and Folders

To open a file, press `Cmd/Ctrl+O` or run `file: open` from the command palette and select the file in the native OS dialog. The file will open in a new tab and the editor will automatically switch to that tab.

To open a project, run `file: open project` from the command palette and select a folder in the OS dialog. This is an experimental feature; The current directory will be shown in the sidebar. Nothing else.
